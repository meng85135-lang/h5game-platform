## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardo-foundry/canvas-vampire-survivors.git
cd canvas-vampire-survivors
npm install     # ESLint + Prettier only — zero runtime deps
npm start       # http://localhost:3000
```

Prefer no Node? Just open `index.html` directly in any modern browser, or
serve the folder with `python -m http.server`.

## 🌐 Play online

An always-up-to-date build ships from `main` to GitHub Pages:

> **▶ <https://ricardo-foundry.github.io/canvas-vampire-survivors/>**

The Pages build is also a [PWA](./manifest.json): on mobile, "Add to Home
Screen" gives you an offline-capable icon thanks to a tiny
[`service-worker.js`](./service-worker.js).

## 📸 Screenshots

Every tile below is a **real PNG capture** taken by
`node scripts/runtime-smoke.js` (headless Chromium + Playwright, dev-only).
The smoke harness fast-forwards game time via the `__SURV_DEBUG__` test hooks
to land on the boss / level-up / death scenes deterministically. SVG mockups
of the same scenes are archived under
[`docs/screenshots/svg/`](./docs/screenshots/svg/) for offline reference.

## Why another Vampire Survivors clone?

Most JS clones ship with a 5 MB bundle and a build pipeline that takes longer
to spin up than the run itself. This repository takes the opposite stance:

1. **Zero dependencies at runtime.** No React, no bundler, no transpiler. Open
   `index.html` and the game is on screen in milliseconds. The `package.json`
   only lists ESLint + Prettier as dev tools.
2. **Open in a browser, period.** The loader handles `file://` AND
   `http(s)://` AND offline (via the optional service worker). Great for
   classrooms, kiosks, code-along livestreams.
3. **Fully auditable source.** Each module under `src/` is self-contained and
   under 1k lines, with a JSDoc header that names every export. No hidden
   build artefacts, no minified vendor blobs.
4. **i18n + accessibility from day one.** English / 简体中文 ship by default,
   `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured, a high-contrast mode lives in
   settings, and every menu is keyboard-reachable.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The runtime is a single `main.js` orchestrator that wires together focused
modules. Every module has a clear job, and there are no runtime dependencies.

## 🆕 What's new

- **v2.7** — Stage 3 + gamepad + deeper mobile polish. **Frozen Tundra**
  ships as the third map with three new modifiers (-10% move speed, +20%
  enemy HP, periodic 1 HP cold tick) and a frost-themed final boss
  **IceQueen**. The input layer now polls the Web Gamepad API every frame
  (left stick = move, right = aim, A = confirm, B = cancel, Start = pause,
  LB / RB = cycle menu options); see [`docs/CONTROLS.md`](./docs/CONTROLS.md).
  Mobile gets a special-skill button next to the joystick, a 0.8 / 1.0 / 1.2
  size knob in settings, and a one-shot PWA install prompt. Three new
  passives (Evasion, Pickup Magnet+, Bulwark) plus four evolution
  micro-tweaks. **195** unit tests, still zero runtime deps. See
  [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md#270---2026-04-25).
- **v2.6** — Content + finishing-touches release. Two stages now ship
  (Whisperwood + the new ranged-heavy Sunken Crypt), plus a daily
  challenge with deterministic per-UTC-day seed and Wordle-style share
  text. Iter-13 closes the loose ends: stage chip on the menu, 14-day
  daily-streak calendar (View Streak), one-time How-to-Play overlay,
  global `M` mute / `H` help hotkeys, and a multi-sample (3×3 patches)
  pixel sanity check in the live-deploy QA script. 167 unit tests, still
  zero runtime deps. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md#260---2026-04-25).
- **v2.5.1** — Camera follow + final-mile polish. The arena is now 2400×1600
  with a viewport-centred camera, every README screenshot is a real PNG
  captured by the Playwright smoke harness, the main menu passes axe-core
  with **0 violations** (WCAG AA contrast on primary buttons, mobile zoom
  re-enabled, ARIA roles on chip rows), and a 5-minute
  [`docs/CONTRIBUTING_QUICKSTART.md`](./docs/CONTRIBUTING_QUICKSTART.md)
  walks new contributors from clone to first PR.
- **v2.5** — Reflection + polish pass. Frost-Nova second pulse now uses the
  effects-layer dt scheduler (pauses correctly with the tab), leaderboard
  Import actually merges into storage, no-hit badge is now an authoritative
  per-run flag, `seenBuilds` capped at 1000 to keep saves small, README fps
  numbers explicitly tagged "(estimated)", `<html lang>` syncs on locale
  switch, generated SVG screenshot placeholders.
- **v2.4** — Content density: 3 new weapons (Frost Nova, Soul Drain,
  Boomerang), 2 enemies (Bomber, Illusionist), 2 bosses (Necromancer, Chrono
  Lich), 6 achievements, deterministic Speedrun mode + leaderboard.
- **v2.3** — Spatial-hash broad phase + object pools (stable 60 fps at 500
  enemies), full keyboard + screen-reader support, 73-test `node:test` suite,
  iOS Safari / reduced-motion / high-contrast polish.
- **v2.2** — Visual polish, GitHub Pages-friendly entry, achievements gallery,
  PWA manifest + offline service worker. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).
- **v2.1** — Wave director, 5 enemy archetypes, 2 bosses, weapon evolutions,
  achievements + leaderboard, effects layer, procedural music upgrade.
- **v2.0** — Modular `src/` rewrite, i18n, fixed-step loop, full OSS scaffolding.

## ⚡ Performance

v2.3 moved the collision broad phase from an O(n²) pairwise scan into a
uniform 64 px spatial hash, pooled the churny entities (floating damage
numbers, particles), pre-rasterised enemy sprites into an offscreen
bitmap cache, and clamped the per-frame `dt` to 50 ms. The sim auto-pauses
on `document.visibilitychange` so a resumed tab cannot dump a 2 s step.

Measured on a 2021 14" MacBook Pro (M1 Pro, Chromium 123), 1200×800 canvas,
in-game enemy cap briefly raised to 500 for the test. Numbers are
**estimated**: a single dev machine, single Chromium build, single sitting,
no statistical sampling. Reproduce locally before quoting them anywhere.

| Scenario                                 | Before (v2.2) (est.) | After (v2.3) (est.) |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 100 enemies, no boss                     | ~60 fps              | ~60 fps             |
| 250 enemies, projectile volley in flight | ~48 fps              | ~60 fps             |
| 500 enemies, Void-Lord phase 2           | **~30 fps**          | **~60 fps**         |
| Tab away 60 s → return, sim catch-up     | 500+ ms spike        | ≤50 ms step         |

Your mileage depends on GPU throughput for canvas composite — on older
integrated-graphics machines the curve flattens earlier. The
[spatial hash](./src/spatial-hash.js), [pool](./src/pool.js) and
[visibility-pause handler](./src/main.js) are isolated modules, so you can
grep `_onVisibilityChange` / `SpatialHash` to see exactly what changed.

## ♿ Accessibility

See [`docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md`](./docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md) for the full list.
Highlights:

- Every menu is keyboard-reachable; level-up cards support `Enter` / `Space`
  and arrow-key nav.
- Visible `:focus-visible` ring, `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` on overlays,
  an ARIA live region that announces boss warnings, level-ups and unlocks.
- Honours `prefers-reduced-motion`, `prefers-contrast: more`,
  `forced-colors: active`, plus an in-game Colorblind toggle.
- Mobile: iOS Safari 100vh fixed via `svh` / `dvh`, no pull-to-refresh,
  no pinch-zoom inside the game.

## ⚠️ Known limitations

Honest list of small issues we have caught but not fixed yet. None block
gameplay; we keep them here so contributors know where the seams are and so
players don't think a wobble is something they did.

- **No service-worker on GitHub Pages cold loads.** `/service-worker.js`
  occasionally returns 404 when the Pages CDN is warming a new commit. The
  registration call demotes the failure to a console warning and the game
  still boots — offline-mode just doesn't kick in until the next hard
  refresh after deploy. The live-deploy smoke (`npm run smoke:live`) treats
  this as a benign warning, not a failure.
- **Replay diverges from non-deterministic runs.** Outside Speedrun and
  Daily, the spawn RNG falls back to `Math.random`, so a saved replay
  reproduces inputs faithfully but spawn positions can drift. Speedrun /
  Daily replays are bit-exact thanks to `SeededRng`. Documented inline in
  `src/main.js`'s `start()` near the recorder construction.
- **Speedrun timer paused/visibility shifts.** Pausing or hiding the tab
  during a Speedrun run is reconciled at resume time (iter-16), so wall-clock
  time excludes paused windows on the leaderboard. If you Alt+Tab for less
  than one frame the visibilitychange event may not fire and a few ms slip
  through; competitive runs should keep the tab focused throughout.
- **localStorage at quota.** Once the browser slot fills up (Safari private
  mode caps at ~5 MB, embedded iframes can be tighter), saves demote to an
  in-memory fallback that survives within the tab session but is lost on
  refresh. A single console warning fires the first time this happens; we
  don't surface a player-visible toast yet.
- **Mid-run locale flip refreshes static labels only.** Switching language
  while playing now retranslates every `data-i18n` element (iter-16), but
  ephemeral runtime strings already rendered as floating text or
  achievement toasts stay in the old locale until they age out — they're
  built once and not retained for re-rendering.
- **Sprite cache grows unbounded.** Pre-rasterised enemy bitmaps live in a
  module-level `Map` keyed by `${id}@${size}`. The set is finite (~100
  entries) so memory growth is capped, but we never evict on stage swap.
  Not a bug, just a thing to know if you instrument the heap.

If you reproduce something that is not on this list, please open an issue
with the steps and (ideally) a recording.

## 🌌 Sister projects

Three small, independent, MIT-licensed repos under the same org. If you
liked this one, the other two are built with the same iterate-in-public,
near-zero-dep philosophy:

- **[openhand](https://github.com/ricardo-foundry/openhand)** — LLM-agnostic,
  plugin-first agent framework. TypeScript strict, sandboxed tools, Docker-ready.
- **[terminal-quest-cli](https://github.com/ricardo-foundry/terminal-quest-cli)**
  — Bilingual terminal RPG with 11 quests and 11 minigames. `npx terminal-quest-cli`
  to play, zero runtime deps.

Each project keeps a `docs/JOURNEY.md` with per-iteration notes — the
"build log" of how it got to its current shape. See [`docs/CROSSPROMO.md`](./docs/CROSSPROMO.md)
for the rationale and the symmetric block on the other two repos.
