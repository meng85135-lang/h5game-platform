## One-minute elevator pitch

Survivor is an open-source roguelite built in plain JavaScript — no
framework, no bundler, no runtime dependencies. You drop the folder on
any static host and it runs; you can even play it offline after the
first visit. The game ships with thirteen weapons (each with a level-5
evolution), ten enemy archetypes, four bosses on a fixed timeline, and
a Speedrun mode with a deterministic seed so runs are comparable down
to the millisecond. There are eighteen achievements — some cheeky, like
"Zen Walker" for surviving five minutes without picking a single
passive. Tests live in `node:test` from the standard library; CI runs
lint + prettier + the test suite on every PR. The whole project is MIT
and the source is deliberately small enough that you can read it in a
weekend and fork it the next. Whether you're learning Canvas, writing a
blog post about game loops, or looking for a reskinnable base for a jam
entry — this is meant for you.
